                <p>Hi everyone! I am <span>Daksh Dixit</span>, a second-year student passionate about web development. On this joyous occasion of Deepawali, I have decided to start a <span>"7 Days, 7 Projects"</span> series. All of my projects will be based on pure HTML and CSS, with <span>no JavaScript, framework, or any library.</span> I aim to be creative with what I know to enhance my designing skills while delving deeper into topics like Grid, animation, and transitions. I hope you will all support me. Thank you and happy holidays!</p>
